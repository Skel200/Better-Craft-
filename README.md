Villagers, Illagers, and Piglins: There are three main factions or communities you will find throughout your gameplay. Through the Custom Origins System, you will find yourself allied with at least one of these groups. They will all come with their own positives and negatives. Currently the most fleshed out of the three is the Villagers. You can however join the Illagers just as easily. Piglins are still being worked on currently so this tab will be updated accordingly.
